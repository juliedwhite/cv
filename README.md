# cv
My CV built using R Markdown and the [vitae](https://github.com/mitchelloharawild/vitae) package. 
Very much a work in progress, so please don't rely upon upon this for complete information. 
The style and basic strucure of the repo was shamelessly borrowed from 
[Han Zhang's CV](https://github.com/hanzhang-psych/cv/).
